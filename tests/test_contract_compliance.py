"""Contract-compliance suite for the protea-runners plugin pack (F6.4).

Sibling slice T1.7 (PROTEA PR #371) shipped
``tests/test_contracts_invariants.py`` in the platform repo. F6.4 is the
plugin-side equivalent: this module enumerates every entry point under
the ``protea.runners`` group and asserts that the loaded object honours
the :class:`protea_contracts.ExperimentRunner` contract. The check is
deliberately group-driven (not hard-coded plugin names) so a new runner
added in ``pyproject.toml`` is automatically covered, and a regression
where someone forgets to subclass the ABC fails the suite without any
test edit.

The entry-point target for every plugin is a *singleton instance* of
the implementing class (see ``lightgbm/__init__.py``:
``plugin = LightgbmRunner()``). The tests therefore use
:func:`isinstance` rather than :func:`issubclass`.
